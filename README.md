Compilation
---

To compile to an executable, run 

`$ gcc -o sysinfo system_info.c -lm`

in a terminal in the same directory as system_info.c

We append `-lm` to link the `math.h` library.

Arguments
---
Running the program with `$ ./sysinfo --help` you will see the possible arguments:

```bash
./sysinfo --help (show this help page)
./sysinfo --user (default argument, report users connected and sessions)
./sysinfo --system (default argument, report system usage)
./sysinfo --graphics (include graphical output where possible)
./sysinfo --sequential (information output sequentially, no refreshing of screen)
./sysinfo --samples=N (take N samples over the specified time)
./sysinfo --tdelay=T (take N samples previously over T time in seconds)
```

By default, running `$ ./sysinfo` will run the program with the user and system arguments, aka 
`$ ./sysinfo --user --system`

To see users connected and their sessions, run
`$ ./sysinfo --user`

To see system information including CPU and memory utilization, run
`$ ./sysinfo --system`
Note: The program will pause for 500ms at the beginning when running this argument to provide accurate data by gathering a baseline sample.

To see how memory information is being calculated and converted, see [`displayMemoryUsage()`](#displayMemoryUsage).

To have a graphical output of the CPU and memory utilization, run
`$ ./sysinfo --graphics`
Note: This will have no effect on user statistics.

***

###### Graphical Legend
':' represents a unit of relative decrease of the memory utilization since the last sample.
'#' represents a unit of relative increase of the memory utilization since the last sample.
A relative decrease graphical string will be suffixed by '@'.
A relative increase graphical string will be suffixed by '*'.  

***

To view the output of the program without the terminal refreshing after samples, run
`$ ./sysinfo --sequential`
Note: This is particularly useful when redirecting the output to a file.

To modify the amount of samples taken run,
`$ ./sysinfo --samples=N`
where N represents the amount of samples you want as a positive integer.

***

###### Example

`$ ./sysinfo --samples=5` will only take 5 samples.

***

To modify the time between samples, run,
`$ ./sysinfo --tdelay=N`
where N represents the time taken between samples in seconds as a positive integer.

***

###### Example

`$ ./sysinfo --tdelay=2` will take 2 seconds between samples.

***

By default, the program will take 10 samples with 1 second in between each sample aka
`$ ./sysinfo --samples=10 --tdelay=1`

***

Code
---

Near the start of the file, you will find two constant string arrays (2D char arrays), that define the help command messages and error messages. This is to keep them in one place and organized so I can easily change them if I need to in the future.

There are also other constants to define how the `/proc/stat` file is formatted and the graphics scale for both CPU and memory utilization.

Underneath are a collection of the function prototypes.

###### main

In the [`main()`](#main) function, we define an array of 6 integers that represent the possible argument flags passed to the program. 0 represents off, and 1 represents on. For samples and time delay, we just put their respective default values, since they are always on.

Then we call a function [`setFlags(int*, int, char**)`](#setFlags) that will take in a reference to the flags array, argc value, and a reference to the argv array.  It will take the arguments provided from the user, parse them, and update the flags array accordingly. If [`setFlags()`](#setFlags) returns 0, there was an error and we return 0 in main to terminate execution of the program.

If there is no error, then we call a function [`composeStats(int*)`](#composeStats) that will take in a reference to the flags array, and accordingly compose the proper output to the terminal based on the flags specified. 

###### displayUserUsage

In the [`displayUserUsage()`](#displayUserUsage) function, we use **utmp.h** to get all the user entries.

Firstly, we reset the pointer to the beginning of the users using `setutent()`. Then we can declare a struct `struct utmp *userEntry = getutent();` which will store a process into the struct. Afterwards we loop until all the entries have been gone over. Inside the loop, we make sure that the process is a user process, then we get the user's information, print it out accordingly, then assign the next user using `getutent()`.

Note: After we are done sampling everything, we accordingly call `endutent()` at the end of [`composeStats(int*)`](#composeStats).

###### displaySystemInformation

In the [`displaySystemInformation()`](#displaySystemInformation) function, we create a buffer struct where we use `uname()` to populate it with system information. If `uname()` returns -1, we have an error and we return out of the function. Otherwise, we can simply access the buffer and print out the system information.

###### displayMemoryUsage

In the [`displayMemoryUsage(int, int sampleSize, int, char[sampleSize][256], double[sampleSize])`](#displayMemoryUsage) function, we create a buffer struct, then use `sysinfo()` to populate it with memory information. If `sysinfo()` returns -1, we have an error and we return out of the function. Otherwise, we calculate and convert the information into usable data as follows.

total_ram = total_bytes / 1000000000  
total_virtual_ram = total_ram + (total_swap / 1000000000)  
used_ram = total_ram - (free_ram / 1000000000)  
used_virtual_ram = total_virtual_ram - ((free_ram + free_swap) / 1000000000)  

Since the memory utilization part shows previous samples, we must store the previously outputted strings in some history array. This is the `char history[sampleSize][256]` parameter. To save the formatted string in the array, we also have an `int sampleCount` parameter that indicates the sample that's currently being rendered. Using these values, we can use `snprintf(history[sampleCount - 1], sizeof(history[sampleCount - 1]), formatted_string_here, values...)` to save the string to the proper location in the array.

If graphics were specified, we will now create a new string called `graphicsLine` that we will concatenate using `strncat()` to our previous string at `history[sampleCount - 1]` after composing it. 

To compose `graphicsLine`, we first check what our maximum length can be based on how much ram exists in the system, and what the scale we set is. For example, if `RAM_GRAPHICS_SCALE = 0.1`, then for every 0.1 gb change of the memory utilization, we will add a single graphical character. Similarily to saving the strings in history, we also need to save the memory used in a double array to calculate relative usage. We do this by setting `historyRam[sampleCount - 1] = usedRam;`

We then use `strcpy()` to copy a single '|' to the string. We then check if this is the first sample. If it is, then we will just set the baseline key as '\*'. Otherwise, we need to calculate the relative utilization.

To do this, we just get the last entry in the double array by using `historyRam[sampleCount - 2]`, and then find the delta with the current memory used by subtracting them. Afterwards, we can just loop until a double exceeds this delta, incrementing by the `RAM_GRAPHICS_SCALE` each time. However, if the delta is negative, our loop is incorrect. For purely the loop's functionality, we use the absolute value of the delta instead, given by `fabs` in `math.h`.

Inside of the loop we check whether the delta is negative or positive. If it is negative, we concatenate the character ':' and if it is positive, we concatenate the character '#'. 

Similarily, outside of the loop we cap the string using the characters '@' and '\*' depending on whether the delta was negative or positive respectively.

Afterwards we also want to append the delta to the string, so we use `snprintf()` to format it to a string, then use `strncat()` to concatenate it to `graphicsLine`.

Finally, we just loop through the history by using `sampleCount` as the exclusive upper bound, and print each respective line.

###### displayCPUUsage

In the [`displayCPUUsage(int, int*, int*, int sampleSize, int, char[sampleSize][256])`](#displayCPUUsage) function, we use `get_nprocs()` from `sys/sysinfo.h` to find the number of CPU cores in the system. Afterwards, we need to calculate the CPU utilization.

We declare two integer variables, `totalTime` and `idleTime`. We then pass their addresses to [`getCPUTimes(int*, int*)`](#getCPUTimes) to populate them with the total time the CPU has been active for, and the CPU's idle time respectively.

Since getting these CPU times will give us the total time the CPU has been working since the system has started, and similarily for idle time, we must find the deltas for these values after some time. To do this, we subtract the `lastTotalTime` and `lastIdleTime` parameters from `totalTime` and `idleTime` respectively. We then call [`getUsagePercent(int, int)`](#getUsagePercent) to find the CPU utilization percent in the form of a double. Afterwards, we can set `lastTotalTime` to `totalTime` and `lastIdleTime` to `idleTime` for the next sample. 

However, we don't have a `lastTotalTime` and `lastIdleTime` for the first sample. To account for this, we will grab a baseline sample in [`composeStats(int*)`](#composeStats) and wait 0.5s to set these variables.

We then print out the CPU usage.

If graphics were specified, we implement it similarly to [`displayMemoryUsage()`](#displayMemoryUsage). The difference is that we don't need to account for a delta and append different characters. All we do is append the character `|` for every unit of scale specified by `CPU_GRAPHICS_SCALE`. 

Finally, we just loop through the history by using `sampleCount` as the exclusive upper bound, and print each respective line.

###### getCPUTimes

In the [`getCPUTimes(int*, int*)`](#getCPUTimes) function, we open and parse the `/proc/stat` file to gather CPU times.

To do this, we use `FILE *stat = fopen("/proc/stat", "r")`. If this file is NULL, then we've encountered an error and we return out of the function.

We then define two integer variables, `currentTotalTime` and `currentIdleTime` and set them to 0. 

Next we define a char array called `cpu` and use `fscanf(stat, "%s', cpu)` to get the first string in the file and put it into `cpu`. 

Afterwards, we compare this string using `strcmp(cpu, "cpu")` to make sure we are looking at the right line in the file. Otherwise, we return out of the function.

Now we can proceed to looping over the seven columns in the first line. I set a constant integer variable called `STAT_COLUMNS` to 7 and we loop from 0 to up to it. 

Inside the loop, we define an integer variable, `time`, then set it to the next integer in the file using `fscanf(stat, "%d", &time)`. Then we add it to `currentTotalTime`. If the column we're going over is the idle column (`IDLE_COLUMN`, 4), then we also set `currentIdleTime` to `time`.

After the loop, we then set the `totalTime` and `idleTime` parameters to `currentTotalTime` and `currentIdleTime`.

We then close the file using `fclose(stat)`.

###### getUsagePercent

In the [`getUsagePercent(int, int)`](#getUsagePercent) function, we just return `(1 - (idleTime / totalTime)) * 100` to get the amount of time the CPU has not been idle in a percent.

###### getCurrentProcessUsage

In the [`getCurrentProcessUsage()`](#getCurrentProcessUsage) function, we open the `/proc/self/status` file using `FILE *status = fopen("/proc/self/status", "r")`. 

We then define a char array of length 30 as `key`, and an integer variable called `currentValue`.

We then try to find the `VmRSS:` row in the file by looping through until the key is equivalent to that string, checking using `strcmp(key, "VmRSS:")`.

Inside of the loop, we use `fscanf(status, "%s %d", key, &currentValue)` to keep saving the new key and value of that key to their respective variables. We also check if it's the end of the file, in which case we close the file using `fclose(status)` and we return -1. Once we come across `VmRSS:`, the loop exits and we close the file using `fclose(status)`, then return `currentValue` since it has been assigned the correct value that is paired with `VmRSS:`.

###### composeStats

In the [`composeStats(int*)`](#composeStats) function, we define integer variables respective to every element in the `flags` array, to make it so we don't have to keep accessing the array.

We also define a `cpuSleepTime` double variable and assign it a value of 500000, which represents a number of microseconds. We also define integer variables `totalTime`, and `idleTime` .

We then check if the program should show the system information, in which case we call [`refreshScreen()`](#refreshScreen) to refresh the screen (Note: We do this regardless of sequential being specified or not, since this only happens once), after which we call [`getCPUTimes()`](#getCPUTimes) and give it the memory addresses of `totalTime` and `idleTime` to populate them with the respective values. Afterwards we sleep for the amount in `cpuSleepTime` using `usleep()`. This was to grab baseline CPU time values so that we can calculate relative values when we actually calculate the utilization.

Then we define two string arrays of length `samples` and string length of 256, to store the memory string history and cpu string history. We also define a double array of length `samples` to store the memory usage history.

We then loop from 1 to upper bound  of `samples + 1` excluded.

Inside the loop, we call [`refreshScreen()`](#refreshScreen) to refresh the screen only if sequential was not specified.

We then print the amount of samples, `samples` and how much time are in between them, `timeDelay`.

Afterwards we find the memory usage of the current process by calling [`getCurrentProcessUsage()`](#getCurrentProcessUsage). We then print this value suffixed by 'kB'.

If user was specified, we call [`displayUserUsage()`](#displayUserUsage). If system was specified, we call [`displaySystemInformation`](#displaySystemInformation), [`displayMemoryUsage()`](#displayMemoryUsage), and [`displayCPUUsage()`](#displayCPUUsage()), with all the variables we have defined previously.

We then flush stdout using `fflush(stdout)` to ensure that our samples get printed during each iteration of the loop, or else they may still be pending inside the buffer and only will print at the end of the samples being taken. Finally, we sleep for the specified `timeDelay` using `sleep(timeDelay)`

Outside of the loop, we also call `endutent()`.

###### refreshScreen

In the [`refreshScreen()`](#refreshScreen) function, we print two escape codes. Firstly we run `printf("\033[0;0H]")` to set the cursor to zero to make sure samples get printed starting in the top left corner of the terminal. Then we run `printf("\033[2J")` to clear the screen.

###### setFlags

In the [`setFlags(int*, int, char**)`](#setFlags) function, we first save the name of the executable ran into a variable by `argv[0]`. This is so that we can print the command name in the help page depending on what the name of the file is, in case the user changed it. Then we loop from 1 to the length of the arguments so that we can go through all the arguments provided to the program through the command line after the executable name. 

Afterwards we define and declare a string, `flag`, using `strtok(argv[i], "=")` to get the key of the argument in case the argument is one where a variable option can be provided, such as `--samples=N and --tdelay=N`. If there is no such variable option, it will still set the flag to the key regardless, so we don't have to check for it. Then we check if the flag provided is `--help` using `strcmp()` in which case we call [`printHelpPage(execName)`](#printHelpPage) using the name of the executable as the argument. We then return 0 to halt the program as specified in  [`main()`](#main). 

Similarily, we compare the other flags using `strcmp()`. In the case that we come across `--user`, we simply set `flags[0]` to 1  to turn it on as that is the index that corresponds to users. The same goes for `--system`, `--graphics`, and `--sequential`. 

If we find a `--samples`, we then need to get the value after the `=`. To do this, we use `strtok()` again on the same pointer. If it returns null, then we know the user didn't follow the required format, in which case we print the corresponding error message and return 0. Otherwise, we then convert the value they specified to an int named `sampleSize` using `strtol()`. We then check if `sampleSize` is valid (>0), and then we set the appropriate element in the `flags` array, `flags[4]` to it. If it is not valid, we then print the corresponding error message and return 0.

The same goes for `--tdelay` as above.

Then if an argument does not match any of these, the final else statement will send an error message and return 0.

Outside of the loop, we check if user and system in `flags` were set. If both were not set, then we set them on as default. 

Finally we return 1 since if we got here, there has been no error.

###### printHelpPage

In the [`printHelpPage(char*)`](#printHelpPage) function, we simply get the length of the constant `HELP_COMMANDS` array by getting the whole size of the array using `sizeof`, and dividing by the `sizeof` one of the elements in the array, `HELP_COMMANDS[0]` being one. Then we can iterate through the array by looping from 0 to the length found earlier exclusively, and printing each one out making sure to provide `execName` at the beginning to give the correct command names.
